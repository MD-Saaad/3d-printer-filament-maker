The purpose of this project is to recycle the plastic bottle waste material into a useful filament by using an Filament maker machine. The study focuses on forming a new filament by using recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) from plastic waste. The recycled filament is then utilized to an open-source 3D printing to create a specimen. The investigation of its mechanical properties is done by comparing the tensile strength, tensile strain, maximum load, and modulus young to pure PET material data. The result shows the original PET specimen can withstand a 724N maximum load while recycled PET specimen can accept 713N.
