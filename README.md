# 3d-printer-filament-maker
The purpose of this project is to recycle the plastic bottle waste material into a useful filament by using an Filament maker machine. The study focuses on forming a new filament by using recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) from plastic waste. The recycled filament is then utilized to an open-source 3D printing to create a specimen.
